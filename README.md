# Gerty
A minimal, dependently-typed programming language

Some of the code is inspired by Agda, so please do check that
great project out!

# Development

## Directory structure

- `src` contains the majority of the source code for the project
- `tests/cases/legacy` contains old examples and tests which
  are incompatible with the current format of the language
  (but may be reintroduced if certain language features are
  added)
